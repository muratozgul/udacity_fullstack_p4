App Engine application for the Udacity training course.

## Products
- [App Engine][1]

## Language
- [Python][2]

## APIs
- [Google Cloud Endpoints][3]

## Setup Instructions
1. Update the value of `application` in `app.yaml` to the app ID you
   have registered in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host
   your instance of this sample.
1. Update the values at the top of `settings.py` to
   reflect the respective client IDs you have registered in the
   [Developer Console][4].
1. Update the value of CLIENT_ID in `static/js/app.js` to the Web client ID
1. (Optional) Mark the configuration files as unchanged as follows:
   `$ git update-index --assume-unchanged app.yaml settings.py static/js/app.js`
1. Run the app with the devserver using `dev_appserver.py DIR`, and ensure it's running by visiting your local server's address (by default [localhost:8080][5].)
1. (Optional) Generate your client library(ies) with [the endpoints tool][6].
1. Deploy your application.

## Task 3: 

### Query Problem

#### Question:  

Letâ€™s say that you don't like workshops and you don't like sessions after 7 pm. How would you handle a query for all non-workshop sessions before 7 pm? What is the problem for implementing this query? What ways to solve it did you think of?  

#### Answer:  
From [docs](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/queries#Datastore_Restrictions_on_queries):  
``` 
Inequality filters are limited to at most one property  

To avoid having to scan the entire index, the query mechanism relies on all of a query's potential results being adjacent to one another in the index. To satisfy this constraint, a single query may not use inequality comparisons (LESS_THAN, LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL, GREATER_THAN, GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL) on more than one property across all of its filters.
```

#### Workarounds:  
Option 1) Apply one inequality filter, do the rest of the filtering by manually iterating  
Option 2) Enumerate possible types (lecture, workshop, training, qa) and use equalities or IN operator for the types other than the undesired ones


### Additional Queries:
1. **getSessionsWithMissingData**: Query for all the sessions that has missing properties. Used for quality user experience, these incomplete sessions can be fixed or deleted.  
2. **getLightningTalks**: Query for all the sessions that are between 5-20 mins long.
